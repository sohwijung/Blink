    <h2>What is Blink?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, you never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory. Blink serves as a medium for people to come together and either share their most precious moments or browse through for some inspiration to capture their upcoming memores. Each picture is associated with various tags that characterize the image and allow others to more easily find what they are looking for.  </p>
